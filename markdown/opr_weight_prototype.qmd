# Testing whether throwing out the first two rounds of matches improves OPR

I'll restrict this code to districts because always having 12 qualification matches makes things significantly easier.

train <- weight_rows(matches, c(rep(1, 10), rep(0, 2)))

Testing for all districts in 2022

Picking 2022 because that was a generally excellent year for OPR (scoring highly separable and linear)

# a district competition (or regional with 12 quals)
