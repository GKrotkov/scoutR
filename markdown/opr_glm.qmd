Key Question: Can we improve OPR's fit to the data by using a GLM? 

I would expect 2018 to be the best candidate year for this method, so we'll test using that at the beginning to see if we can get a meaningful enough improvement to continue investigating. 

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
library(devtools)
load_all()

gpr <- event_matches("2024paca", match_type = "qual", simple = TRUE)
scores <- c(gpr$blue_score, gpr$red_score)

viz <- data.frame(scores)

hist(scores)
hist(abs(scores) - mean(scores))
hist(sqrt(scores))

fit <- fit_lineup_lm(gpr, list(red = gpr$red_score, blue = gpr$blue_score))

resid <- residuals(fit)

hist(resid, freq = FALSE, 
     main = "Residuals look pretty normal")
curve(dnorm(x, mean(resid), sd(resid)), add = TRUE)

```
