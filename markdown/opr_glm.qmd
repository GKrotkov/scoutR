Key Question: Can we improve OPR's fit to the data by using a GLM? 

I would expect 2018 to be the best candidate year for this method, so we'll test using that at the beginning to see if we can get a meaningful enough improvement to continue investigating. 

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
library(devtools)
load_all()

gpr <- event_matches("2024paca", match_type = "qual")
load("../data/opr_binvar.rda")

linear_fit <- fit_lineup_lm(
    gpr, 
    list(red = gpr$red_score, blue = gpr$blue_score), 
    w_bins
)

plot(linear_fit, which = 1:6)
```

```{r}
design <- lineup_design_matrix(gpr)
response <- c(gpr$blue_score, gpr$red_score)
rlm_fit <- rlm(design, response)
```
