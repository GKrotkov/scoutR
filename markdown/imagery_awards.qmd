Quick markdown file to count the number of imagery awards. For now I won't consider the "Most Photogenic" award from early FRC.

```{r}
awards <- readRDS("../data/all_team_awards.rds")

count_imagery <- function(team_awards){
    if (ncol(team_awards) == 0) return(0)
    return(length(grep("Imagery", team_awards$name)))
}

img_count <- sort(sapply(awards, count_imagery), decreasing = TRUE)
img <- data.frame(team = names(img_count), imagery_awards = img_count)

write_csv(img, file = "../data/awards/imagery_award_counts.csv")

library(pander)

pander(table(img_count), 
       caption = "Imagery Award Counts (via TBA API)")

hist(img_count)
```
