# WTF is up with 2022iscmp, 2022chcmp, and 2022micmp3?

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
iscmp <- event_matches("2022iscmp", match_type = "qual")
chcmp <- event_matches("2022chcmp", match_type = "qual")
aptiv <- event_matches("2022micmp3", match_type = "qual")
```

Looking at this event report, none of these match what `TBA Insights` shows (they are pretty close, usually within 0.5 - however the problems are more pronounced for APTIV.)

```{r}
event_report <- function(evnt, label){
    margin <- abs(evnt$red_score - evnt$blue_score)
    winning_score <- pmax(evnt$red_score, evnt$blue_score)
    scores <- c(evnt$red_score, evnt$blue_score)
    cat("For the", label, "event, the data shows:\n", 
        "Average score -", mean(scores), "\n", 
        "Average winning score -", mean(winning_score), "\n", 
        "Average winning margin -", mean(margin), "\n")
}

event_report(iscmp, "Israel DCMP")
event_report(chcmp, "CHS DCMP")
event_report(aptiv, "Aptiv Division")
```

Let's take a look at APTIV specifically since the disagreement is the most pronounced there. 

```{r}
margin <- abs(aptiv$red_score - aptiv$blue_score)
winning_score <- pmax(aptiv$red_score, aptiv$blue_score)
```

Manual inspection of the scores doesn't reveal a difference between the scores listed on TBA and the scores output by the API.

# Double Harmonies?

```{r}
cresc_evnts <- events(2024, keys = TRUE)
cresc_matches <- lapply(cresc_evnts, event_matches)
cresc_matches <- cresc_matches[!is.na(cresc_matches)]

get_harmonies <- function(df){
    return(c(df$blue_endGameHarmonyPoints, df$red_endGameHarmonyPoints))
}

# How many alliances had 4 harmony points?
suppressWarnings(
    sum(unlist(sapply(cresc_matches, get_harmonies)) == 4, na.rm = TRUE)
)

# Modeling District Point Threshold

We'll start with just CMP qualification. I'm choosing to subset to 2018 and later because that's when TBA starts reporting CMP qualification.

@TODO need to account for the overall size of the championship in each given year

Maybe it would be easier to just try to model it based on percentile points?

```{r}
# TBA first started reporting CMP qualification in 2018
district_keys <- c(
    "2019tx", paste0(2022:2024, "fit"), paste0(2018:2024, "fim"), 
    paste0(2018:2024, "chs"), paste0(2018:2024, "isr"), 
    paste0(2018:2024, "fma"), paste0(2018:2024, "fnc"), 
    paste0(2018:2024, "ne"), paste0(2018:2024, "ont"), 
    paste0(2018:2024, "pnw"), paste0(2018:2024, "pch"), 
    paste0(2018:2024, "fin")
)

# remove 2020 and 2021 bc COVID
district_keys <- district_keys[-grep("(2020|2021)", district_keys)]

rankings <- lapply(district_keys, district_rankings, 
                   separate_events = TRUE, event_breakdown = TRUE)
names(rankings) <- district_keys

district_size <- sapply(
    rankings, 
    function(rankings){ 
        sum(rankings$point_total > 0, na.rm = TRUE)
    }
)
district_df <- data.frame(key = district_keys, size = district_size)
names(district_size) <- district_keys

predcmp_pts <- lapply(
    rankings, function(rankings){
        predcmp_pts <- rankings$total_event_1 + rankings$total_event_2
        names(predcmp_pts) <- rankings$team_key

# RAS Sustainability

teams who won RAS
- rookie year
- first Impact win

Questions for Zaque: 
- How did you account for "Rookie All-Star" as opposed to "Rookie All Star"
- Did you count awards like "Chairman's Award Finalist"? Did you count "Chairmans Award"?

```{r}
all_team_awards <- readRDS("../data/awards/all_team_awards.rds")

extract_cols <- function(team){
    if (nrow(team) == 0) return(
        data.frame(
            ras_year = NA, first_impact = NA, n_impacts = 0, first_ei = NA,
            n_eis = 0
        )
    )
    return(data.frame(
        ras_year = team$year[grep("Rookie All[- ]Star", team$name)[1]], 
        first_impact = team$year[grep("Chairman'?s|Impact", team$name)[1]],
        n_impacts = length(grep("Chairman'?s|Impact", team$name)),
        first_ei = team$year[grep("Engineering Inspiration", team$name)[1]],
        n_eis = length(grep("Engineering Inspiration", team$name))
    ))
}

df <- lapply(all_team_awards, extract_cols)

df <- Reduce(rbind, df)
df$id <- tmp

ras <- df[!is.na(df$ras_year), ]
ras$yrs_to_impact <- ras$first_impact - ras$ras_year
