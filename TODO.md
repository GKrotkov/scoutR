# TODO

## Short Term
1) `get_multifield_df` should include an "n_matches" column

## Long term:
1) Generic, automated data validation via `tba_validatoR`
    - GoS will not develop this this year, because we will rely on tbaR to
    provide the data for everything it can - we won't have anything to compare
    against.
2) local OPR/EPA calculators? Include some weighting on match recency?
