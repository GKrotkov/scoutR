# TODO

## Periodic
- renv::snapshot() to update libraries
- document() to call roxygen documentation handlers

# Bugs
- OPR calculated by linear regression is different from TBA's OPR for the events: 2022chcmp, 2022iscmp, 2022micmp3

## Long term:
- Generic, automated data validation via `tba_validatoR`
- Team comparison generator (based on award history, performance over time, etc.)
    - Idea is to make a big dataframe, run PCA on it, and then use that to evaluate "distances" between teams.
    - Data to include: yearly EPA, # of competitions each year, 

- OPR improvements
    - "dropout" idea where when a robot suffers catastrophic failure, set their indicator variable in the design matrix to 0.
- Statbotics tidyR, update tba_interfaceR to just be interfaceR and include default parameters to switch between statbotics and TBA.

## Back Burner

- Tim (Angert) wants some kind of printout to show who was available for each individual pick of the alliance selection.
- local EPA calculation
