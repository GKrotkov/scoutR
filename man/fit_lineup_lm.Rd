\title{Fit Lineup Linear Model}
\usage{
fit_lineup_lm(lineups, responses, w = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{lineups}{A dataframe of lineups assumed to have the columns `blue1`,
`blue2`, `blue3`, `red1`, `red2`, and `red3`. This can be like a dataframe
of matches as output by `event_matches`.}

\item{responses}{A list of two vectors, `red` and `blue`. Each must be a
vector of the same length as the number of rows in `lineups`, representing
the response value to fit a linear model to.}

\item{w}{Weights for WLS fit. Weights will be extended with `rep_len` to have
length corresponding to the rows of `lineups`.}
}
\description{
Computes the lineup design matrix for a given dataframe `lineups`, and then
fits a linear model using the given `responses`.
}
\details{
Key assumption - the order of `lineups` and the `responses` vector
must line up exactly. Otherwise, the fit will be meaningless. Fits a
regression through the origin - fixing the intercept coefficient to be 0.
Regression should always be through the origin both for model validity (we
want the matrix to have full rank) and because, unlike with basketball
(R)APM, there is no home team advantage to account for.

gpr <- event_matches("2024paca", match_type = "qual")
opr <- fit_lineup_lm(gpr, list(red = gpr$red_score, blue = gpr$blue_score))
